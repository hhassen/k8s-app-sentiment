##Â Kubernetes
* Set up `minikube` to run Kubernetes locally.
#### Pods
* Launch **pods** manually
* Access to the application externally using port-forwarding: `kubectl port-forward sa-frontend 88:80`
* Duplicate the pod manually (the wrong way to do things)
#### Services
* Set up a Load Balancer **service** to access our target pods
* Apply **Labels** to the pods we want to access
* Apply a **Selector** to our service using that Labels
* `kubectl get pod -l app=sa-frontend`
#### Deployment
* Use Kubernetes **Deployment** to deploy each application
* Delete pods created manually : `kubectl delete pod <pod-name>`
* Delete one of the pods deployed : another one is automatically launched.
* Make a rollout to a new version: `kubectl apply -f sa-frontend-deployment-green.yaml --record`.
* Roll back to the previous version `kubectl rollout history deployment sa-frontend` and `kubectl rollout undo deployment sa-frontend --to-revision=1`
#### KUBE-DNS
* Get IP address of a service
#### Amazon EKS
* Migrate our local cluster to amazon EKS
